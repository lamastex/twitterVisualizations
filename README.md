# Description

This is a part of my undergraduate project within Project MEP.

This is a webpage with visualizations of Twitter data using D3. The visualizations allows for exploratory data analysis of Twitter data. However, no data is provided from me - you have to collect it with your own Twitter credentials to comply with data protection laws and rules.

# Get started

Requirements: [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run the web server.

From the command line:


1. Download the repository:

⋅⋅⋅`
    git clone https://github.com/olofbjorck/twitterVisualizations.git
   `

2. Navigate to the files:

⋅⋅⋅`
    cd twitterVisualizations
   `

3. Start the web server (this is where Node is required):

  `
  node server.js
  `

4. Open the webpage in a browser: http://localhost:8080/.


  **Note:** I've only used and tested it in Chrome.
