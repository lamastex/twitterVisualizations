<h1>Description</h1>

<p>

This is a graph visualization of a Twitter graph.

Each circle represents a Twitter user (that is, a unique Twitter account).

The radius of the user circle represents how many Retweets the user has within this specific Twitter network from small radius (fewest Retweets) to large radius (most Retweets).

If you hover a user circle, the user screen name (as specified in the data) will appear by the user circle.

The line thickness connecting user circles represents how many Retweets the user circle tuple tuple has between each other in total.

Retweet direction is not accounted for.

Connecting lines only appear if the user circle tuple has at least 15 Retweets.

If you click on a user circle, the up-to-date user timeline will appear.

You can click on the user timeline to be redirected to Twitter's web site and view the user.

<h2>Improvement ideas</h2>

<ul>

	<li>Speed up tooltip display. For example by custom tooltip.</li>
	<li>Add a slider to select number of Retweets cut-off rate (currently 15). Small cut-off rate drastically decrease performance though.</li>
	<li>Add a zoom to get rid of the large canvas.</li>
	<li>Fix the rather bad performance.</li>
	<li>Add a search for Twitter users function.</li>
	<li>Color by group (this is kind of implemented but group data is needed).</li>
	<li>Account for the Retweet direction.</li>

</ul>
