<h1>Description</h1>

<p>

This is a visualization of a Twitter user's timeline.

Each circle represents a Tweet.

The x-axis shows the time a Tweet was posted and the y-axis shows the Tweet type of the Tweet.

You can zoom the displayed time interval by scrolling.

If you hover over a Tweet, the Tweet text will appear in the upper left corner and the Tweet you're hovering will become enlarged.

Above the Tweet text in the upper left corner, there's a search box that let's you search all Tweets.

If the character sequence you're searching for appears in a Tweet text, the Tweet circle where the character sequence is found is enlarged and colored yellow.

If you click on a Tweet, the actual Tweet will pop up.

You can click on the actual Tweet to be redirected to Twitter's web site and view the full Tweet with replies and comments.

<h2>Improvement ideas</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Fix: First data entry doesn't appear for some reason.</li>
	<li>Set radius or color or something on how many Retweets each Tweet has. Dependent on when data is collected though.</li>

</ul>
