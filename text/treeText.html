<h1>Description</h1>

<p>

This is a visualization of a Twitter network.

Each circle represents a Twitter user (that is, a unique Twitter account).

The color of the user circle represents how many followers the user has from blue (fewest) to red (most).

The radius of the user circle also represents how many followers the user has from small radius (fewest) to large radius (most).

The x-axis shows the number of Retweets of a user within the Twitter network (that is, the number of times the user was Retweeted by users in this specific Twitter network).

The y-axis shows the number of unique Retweeters within the Twitter network (that is, the number of unique users in this specific Twitter network that Retweeted a user).

If you hover a user circle, the user screen name (as specified in the data) will appear by the user circle and the user circle you're hovering will become enlarged.

If you click on a user circle, the up-to-date user timeline will appear.

You can click on the user timeline to be redirected to Twitter's web site and view the user.
