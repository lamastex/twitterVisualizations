<h1>Description</h1>

<p>

This is a visualization of a Twitter network.

Each circle represents a Twitter user (that is, a unique Twitter account).

The color of the user circle represents how many followers the user has from blue (fewest) to red (most).

The x-axis shows the number of Retweets of a user within the Twitter network (that is, the number of times the user was Retweeted by users in this specific Twitter network).

The y-axis shows the number of unique Retweeters within the Twitter network (that is, the number of unique users in this specific Twitter network that Retweeted a user).

If you hover a user circle, the user screen name (as specified in the data) will appear by the user circle and the user circle you're hovering will become enlarged.

If you click on a user circle, the up-to-date user timeline will appear.

You can click on the user timeline to be redirected to Twitter's web site and view the user.
